# 1. Building The Math Bounty dApp Off-Chain Library

In this tutorial series we will be building a simple "Math Bounty" dApp using the Ergo Protocol Framework. In short, this dApp allows individuals to lock Ergs up under a contract which allows anyone to withdraw them if they solve the math problem inside. This idea for this dApp originally came from [this Ergo Forum Thread](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/mathematical-fun-with-ergoscript/76).

In our case we'll be using a simpler problem/contract to make it easy to follow along.

1. A math problem is encoded within the smart contract that must be solved.
2. Anyone can bootstrap a UTXO at the "Math Problem" stage which


1. For each stage create an empty struct with the name of your Stage.
```rust
pub struct LiveEpoch {}
```
